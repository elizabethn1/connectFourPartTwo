This program replicates Connect 4 and builds off of my program in the connectFourPartOne repository.
(I modified some of my code from connectFourPartOne to create connectFourPartTwo.)
Two players take turns placing their piece into the board until
one of them is able to get their pieces to be four in a row
(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), a player quits the game,
or the board is full and no one wins. This updated version of the program in connectFourPartOne
also allows players to undo a move and print the past moves.
